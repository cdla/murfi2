- seems like datastore can't handle lots of different image types
  coming at once. things work ok when you are just looking for scanner
  images, but when you run a pratical example with a config file that
  does more processing the processed series come out crazy in the gui.

- very unstable when selecting data for display from the datastore or
  via graph selection

- frame borders dont match frame size on startup

- slice selection and roi tools seem to be half a volume off?
