####################  Overview  ######################################

The Siemens receiver application saves images sent via TCP/IP from a
scanner enabled with the External Sender ICE functor. The receiver
runs on a computer that is on the same network as the scanner host (or
on the host itself) and runs a server that listens for images sent by
the External Sender ICE functor. Images are saved to disk, as well as
MoCo images if motion correction is turned on in the sequence. The
target directory and filenames are configurable, and each incoming
series is identified and handled in a rational manner. The application
runs on linux and windows.

#######################################################################


####################  Running  ########################################

You must be connected to the same network as the scanner. The External
Sender functor on the scanner must be configured to send images to the
ip address of your computer (see the External Sender functor
documentation). 

The application 'siemens_receiver' must be executed from the command
line. The application takes several arguments:

usage: ./siemens_receiver [options]
  where options are:
    -d dir:       directory to save into (default is '.')
    -f filestem:  beginning of filenames (default 'img')
    -p port:      port to listen on (default 15000)
    -m flag:      1 or 0 whether to ignore non-moco images (default 0)
    -q flag:      1 or 0 whether to suppress output (default 0)

To stop the application terminate the command line process using
Ctrl-C.

The receiver application is designed so that it needs to be executed
just once per scanning session. Each time the first image of a new run
is received the run number is automatically incremented. There is no
need to stop the application between runs. 

#######################################################################


####################  Image file format  ##############################

RAW images are written. This is a binary file in the following format:
*) number of image dimensions (unsigned int 32)
*) size of each dimension (unsigned int 32)
*) data (short 16)

The included file 'read_raw.m' will load a RAW image into octave or
matlab.

#######################################################################


####################  Known issues  ###################################

*) Although the termination of the program and the associated network
   connection is handled properly, sometimes there is a lag after
   program termination where the connection doesn't look closed to the
   operating system, and the application fails to start the server on
   startup. Things go back to normal after a few seconds, so just wait
   a minute and try again. Note that if the server fails to start the
   first time you run the application something else is wrong. Also,
   I have only experienced this behavior on linux, so if you find it
   happening on windows let me know.

*) If the application is run once with the "-m 1" flag to only save
   moco images and then again but this time saving all images (without
   the flag) the application will fail to identify the files written
   during th previous run and overwrite them.

####################  Compilation  ####################################

********
windows:

Both compilation with visual c++ and mingw g++ (http://www.mingw.org/)
are supported. The windows makefile (makefile.win) is setup to use
mingw g++ by default. To compile with visual c++ edit makefile.win and
comment out the GNU stuff and uncomment the M$ stuff.

For either compiler, at the command line, execute
make -f makefile.win


********
linux:

At the command line, execute
make -f makefile.linux
