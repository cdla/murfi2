CMake build system (Allows out of source builds)

Install Cmake 2.4 or greater

----
Building a binary
----
Note: Currently CMake doesn't check to see if all dependencies are satisfied. So please ensure that all the required libraries are installed on the system.

Now create a directory structure for building:
build
build/release
build/debug

Switch to the the build or debug directory and type:

ccmake PATH_TO_FASTR_SRC_FOLDER
type 'c' to configure
and  'g' to generate Makefiles/Solution files

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                 Debug/Release
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             PATH_TO_INSTALL


---- 
Modifying CMakeLists.txt
----

Every directory in the source tree has a CMakeLists.txt file. Any file added/removed in a given directory should be added/removed inside the CMakeLists.txt file. 

Any directory added/removed from the src directory should be added/removed from the SUBDIR section (see the top level CMakeLists.txt) for an example. Any new directory should contain a CMakeLists.txt file. If it's a library that gets added to fastr see a lib directory (e.g., stream). If it's an executable, see a bin directory (e.g., executive, imgserver).

Currently all include directories are provided by the top level make file and sent to all make processes. As the system gets modular, this will change.
