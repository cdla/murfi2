* config:
 - allow spec of input data ids in module names

* logging:
 - adapt ace logger framework to allow writing to files and screen
   simultaneously. 
 - provide nice interface for logging
 - add auto logging code to processing 

* streams:
 - work on serial/parallel processing dependencies
 - allow easier accessing of data produced earlier in a stream
 - consider eliminating distinction between preprocessing, analysis,
   and postprocessing

* data
 - enforce data persistence accounting
 - make sure all non-persistent data cleaned up after stream
   completion
 - develop flexible, efficient method for retreiving persistent data
   (hashing?). mak available to gui as well
 - think about id stuff (make id strings consistent '-','_', etc.)

* data structures
 - roi 
 - mask 

* algorithms
 - gembris (2000) correlation
 - kalman filter (rouche 2004)
 - roi activation
 - hooks for external apps
  + motion correction
  + intensity normalization
  + spatial normalization?

* simple gui
 - overlay (z-scores on epi)
