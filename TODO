NOWNOWNOW
- integrate registration methods. 
- add roi viewing/editing to gui
- add conditions to info server
- fix incremental GLM
- look into image saving (DONE)

* config:
 - allow spec of input data ids in module names

* logging:
 - adapt ace logger framework to allow writing to files and screen
   simultaneously. 
 - provide nice interface for logging
 - add auto logging code to processing 

* streams:
 - work on serial/parallel processing dependencies
 - allow easier accessing of data produced earlier in a stream
 - consider eliminating distinction between preprocessing, analysis,
   and postprocessing

* data
 - enforce directory structure (make structure as well)
 - make standardized interface to serialize data using XML. 
 - clean up setInfo parts of RtActivation and RtMaskImage (for
   creation based on geometry of other images)
 - add interator type interface for mask image
 - convert to nii image representation
 - convert all numerics to vxl
 - enforce data persistence accounting
 - make sure all non-persistent data cleaned up after stream
   completion
 - develop flexible, efficient method for retreiving persistent data
   (hashing?). make available to gui and info server as well
 - also develop either method for unique ids for each data instance or
   iterator method to choose like data
 - think about id stuff (make id strings consistent '-','_', etc.)
 - add nifti reading/writing (DONE)
 - add (un)mosaic 

* data structures
 - fill out functionality in RtDataImage.h and turn it into a .txx
 - roi 
 - RtMaskImage has duplicated functionality to handle RtMRIImage 
   and RtActivation


* algorithms
 - cox (1995) accumulative correlation (DONE)
 - gembris (2000) sliding window correlation
 - kalman filter (rouche 2004)
 - hinds (2008) single image correlation 
   first implementation done. method needs to be extended
   to allow arbitrary contrasts
 - add baseline scans at beginning to let stabilize (DONE)
 - roi activation (DONE)
 - roi-based spatial subtraction
 - completely general ROI sum arithmetic
 - hooks for external apps
  + motion correction
  + intensity normalization
  + registration
  + brain mask computation (DONE)

* communication
 - fix Nan problem
 - setting up stim schedule
 - add conditions to infoserver

* simple gui
 - overlay (z-scores on epi) (DONE, but need fixed)
