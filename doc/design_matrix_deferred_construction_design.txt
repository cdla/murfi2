This is a design for modifying murfi to defer the construction of the
model design matrix. The goal is to allow the number and length of TRs
to be specified by the stimulus software or by the user explicitly on
the command line. There will no longer be a way to set this
information in the configuration file. In addition, mismatch between
these values as specified on the command line, by the stimulus
software, or indicated in the image headers received from the scanner
will result in an informative assertion and exit.

* Removing ability to spec in the conf file

** RtInputScannerImages.cpp
- remove setting of numImagesExpected member
- add a setter for numImagesExpected for use from infoclient/server
  and RtExperiment.
- check imageNumber and numImagesExpected within svc, assigned from
  image header
- check tr info against experiment config values. if they aren't the
  same, assert
- while at it, remove all geom and timing members, unneeded.

* Adding ability to spec on the command line
** RtExperiment.cpp
- add options in parseArgs
- add static vars to store values
- add vars to the experiment conf

* Adding ability to spec from the infoclient
- add check for setting tr info in receiveMessage
- when msg received, check that tr spec matches, if set via command line
- if not set via command line, set info in experiment conf, trigger
  design matrix build.

* Adding ability to spec from the infoserver
- add check for setting tr info in receiveMessage
- when msg received, check that tr spec matches, if set via command line
- if not set via command line, set info in experiment conf, trigger
  design matrix build.
