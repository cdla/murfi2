This is a design for modifying murfi to defer the construction of the
model design matrix. The goal is to allow the number and length of TRs
to be specified by the stimulus software or by the user explicitly on
the command line. There will no longer be a way to set this
information in the configuration file. In addition, mismatch between
these values as specified on the command line, by the stimulus
software, or indicated in the image headers received from the scanner
will result in an informative assertion and exit.

* Removing ability to spec in the conf file
** RtInputScannerImages.cpp
*** RtInputScannerImages::init
- remove setting of numImagesExpected and initialized


* Add ability to set
** RtInputScannerImages.cpp
*** RtInputScannerImages::init
- remove setting of numImagesExpected and initialized

* Adding ability to spec on the command line

* Adding ability to spec from the infoclient

* Adding ability to spec from the infoserver

* Validating against values in the image header
